    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="heart"></div>
      In your eyes, I found the place where all my lost pieces belong<br><br>
      a quiet kind of melody that's been my heart's true song<br><br>
      i hear your voice and the noise of life fades away<br><br>
      your voice is a song my heart longs to play<br><br>
      you are my 8th wonder of the world<br><br>
      you give beauty a more ethereal rendition, it's like you carry the beauty of the universe in your honesty<br><br>
      with you,my heart rushes with peace,like waves along a coast<br><br>
      you are my proverbs 18 woman,a rare grace,a favor heaven chose to place<br><br>
      your smile softens storms within my soul,her love turns ordinary days to gold<br><br>
      you speak words with your eyes and every glance feels like poetry in motion<br><br>
      In your gaze I find devotion, a heart stirring potion<br><br>
      You complete my equation, where I and U meet, the sum is love, eternal and sweet<br><br>
      I hear your laugh and I want to thank God on everyone's behalf<br><br>
      You are proof that God listens, cause everything I prayed for even more is embodied in you<br><br>
      If the sun ever stopped to shine, no one would notice cause as soon as you smile the world would light up<br><br>
      I'm so lucky God let me exist at the same time as you<br><br>
      You came when my heart was sealed behind iron doors, yet you slipped through the guards of my soul<br><br>
      I knew something was special about you from that moment on<br><br>
      Your beauty a fact, the softness of your cadence<br><br>
      I think you're really pretty, it's pretty easy to see<br><br>
      but the prettiest thing about you is your soul<br><br>
      Your type of beauty is the kind in museums, if it were in painting it would be The Monalisa<br><br>
      mysterious, timeless, and impossible to forget<br><br>
      I could keep writing about you but I don't think I have enough words in my vocabulary to capture what my heart sees<br><br>
      For beauty like yours exists beyond the reach of language
